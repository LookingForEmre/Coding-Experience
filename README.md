# Coding-Experience
Here are examples of my coding experience:


### SQRT.py

The code **calculates the square root of a number** using the **Newton-Raphson method** for non-negative inputs and the complex square root function for negative inputs. For non-negative numbers, it employs a **recursive function to iteratively apply the Newton-Raphson update formula** until the result converges within a specified tolerance. The function determines which method to use based on whether the input is negative or non-negative, and the program prompts the user for input, computes the square root.
